Specifically, I wanted to show customers the services that are rendered and provide examples. Additionally, I wanted the site to have links to the business's Yelp, Instagram, and/or Facebook page.",

            approach: "I focused on making the site mobile-friendly, as I thought that most customers would look up a mobile service using their phones. To ensure that the site was mobile-friendly, I checked its responsiveness by changing the screen size using the DevTools. Additionally, I used Bootstrap to make the site dynamic."

            approach: "First, I looked into other ways to store data. Since this was going to be a client-side application, I decided to use localStorage. localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means that the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is closed."
